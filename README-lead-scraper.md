# AI Lead Scraper

The AI Lead Scraper is a simple tool that uses AI to generate potential leads based on your specific requirements.

## Features

- **Simple Interface**: Enter your lead requirements in natural language
- **AI-Powered**: Utilizes Google's Gemini AI to understand and generate leads
- **Customizable**: Specify industry, location, and other parameters
- **Responsive UI**: Works on all devices

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the Lead Scraper page by clicking on "Lead Scraper" in the sidebar
2. Enter your lead requirements in the search box (for example: "tech startups in London" or "renewable energy companies in California")
3. Click "Search" or press Enter
4. View the generated leads displayed as cards

## Example Queries

- "Find software development companies in New York"
- "Healthcare startups in Boston area"
- "E-commerce businesses in Toronto"
- "B2B SaaS companies with 50+ employees"

## Implementation Details

The lead scraper works by:

1. Using AI to interpret your natural language query
2. Extracting key parameters like industry, location, and keywords
3. Generating a list of potential leads that match your criteria
4. Presenting the results in an organized, card-based layout

The system is designed to generate plausible leads rather than connecting to a real database of companies. In a production environment, this could be enhanced to search actual company databases or integrate with services like LinkedIn, Crunchbase, or other B2B data providers.

## Future Enhancements

- Export leads to CSV
- Save searches and receive notifications for new matching leads
- Integration with CRM systems
- Email verification for lead contacts
- Company information enrichment from additional sources
